# 🎥 VisionCast: Accessible Video for Everyone

VisionCast is a modern, AI-powered platform designed to bridge the gap between sight and sound. By generating automated, high-precision audio descriptions, we make visual content inclusive for everyone, including the visually impaired.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Smart Narration**: Leveraging advanced AI to describe actions, emotions, and on-screen text in real-time.
* **Intelligent Timing**: Our algorithm detects silent gaps in video to insert descriptions without overlapping dialogue.
* **Accessibility Dashboard**: A dedicated workspace with a built-in video player, Q&A interaction, and live accessibility scripts.
* **Custom Experiences**: Toggle between different narration modes (Read Frame vs. Read Complete) and select preferred voice profiles.
* **Responsive UI**: A sleek, high-end "Dark Mode" interface built for performance and scannability.
